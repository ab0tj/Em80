# Em80
Em80 8080 Emulator

This program simulates an 8080 CPU and various peripherals. It was designed for testing code before running on real hardware.
Therefore, the focus is more on debugging capabilities instead of speed.

This project is still under development, but it does work well enough to run programs from memory or disk.
